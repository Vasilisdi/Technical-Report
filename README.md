## 📌 Abstract  
This thesis investigates the design and implementation of a software system for machine vibration analysis, focusing on [briefly state key goals, e.g., "real-time monitoring, fault detection, and predictive maintenance using signal processing techniques"]. The proposed solution leverages [mention key technologies, e.g., "FFT algorithms, machine learning, or IoT frameworks"] to achieve [main outcomes].
