## 📌 Abstract  
This thesis investigates the design and implementation of a software system for **continuous, year-round machine vibration monitoring**, enabling robust detection of mechanical component failures. By analyzing vibration data through **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** techniques, the system identifies fault patterns to generate actionable insights for **predictive maintenance planning**. The proposed solution combines **state-of-the-art technologies** with **low-cost hardware** (e.g. ADXL335 accelerometers), balancing accuracy and affordability for industrial applications.  

Key outcomes:  
✅ Real-time fault detection in rotating machinery  
✅ Data-driven preventive maintenance strategies  
✅ Cost-effective FFT-based analysis pipeline
