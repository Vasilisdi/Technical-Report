\section{Fundamentals of Bearing Fault Frequencies}
{
\subsection{Overview}
{
The most significant challenge that the authors had to deal with is that of the faulty cases detection. For this reason, fault and unfault models have been developed, and series of comparisons between the actual model generated by apparatus measurements and these two situational models are being executed. This development constitutes a real challenge since this is the main criterion that identifies the state of the motor.
}

\subsection{Unfault and Fault Models}
{
As previously mentioned, the authors make use of a model-based approach, which entails that the main concept is comparison-oriented. Specifically, there is the unfault model, which contains a high-amplitude peak at the shaft rotating frequency $F_{\omega}$. In addition to that, it can be noticed in Figure~\ref{fig:faultsunfaults} that some other patterns distinct themselves from the previously-mentioned unfault model. Regarding the unbalance model, it is obvious that the amplitude at the first tone is much greater. In the case of the misalignment model, it can be noticed that the tone at $2F_{\omega}$ has a much greater amplitude while the amplitude at the tone of the shaft speed $F_{\omega}$ remains at a high level. In the case of looseness, there are some more tones prevailing on the spectrum, among the tones related to the shaft speed. To top it all off, the most important vibration spectrum is that of the bearing failure (Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:faultTree}). Every bearing is characterized by four critical frequencies, given by its manufacturer, and these frequencies are associated with the four bearing components (inner and outer ring, balls, and cage):

\begin{itemize}
	\item BPFO (Ball Pass Frequency Outer) - outer race failure
	\item BPFI (Ball Pass Frequency Inner) - inner race failure
	\item BSF (Ball Spin Frequency) - rolling element failure
	\item FTF (Fundamental Train Frequency) - cage failure
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Fault and unfault spectrum graphs \cite{Betta2002}.}
\label{fig:faultsunfaults}
\end{figure}

The procedure to calculate critical frequencies involves two steps: first computing the bearing frequency factors, then deriving the vibration frequencies. The following analysis covers the case where the inner race rotates while the outer race remains stationary.

\begin{align}
	F_{\text{OR}} &= \frac{Z}{2} \left(1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos\alpha\right) 
	&&\text{(Outer Race Fault)} \label{eq:OR} \\
	F_{\text{IR}} &= \frac{Z}{2} \left(1 + \frac{d}{D} \cos\alpha\right) 
	&&\text{(Inner Race Fault)} \label{eq:IR} \\
	F_{\text{FTF}} &= \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{d}{D} \cos\alpha\right) 
	&&\text{(Cage Frequency, Inner Race Rotating)} \label{eq:FT} \\
	F_{\text{BS}} &= \frac{D}{d} \left[1 - \left(\frac{d}{D}\right)^2 \cos^2\alpha\right] 
	&&\text{(Ball Spin Frequency)} \label{eq:BS}
\end{align}

Then, the aforementioned factors when multiplied with shaft speed ($f$) give specific critical bearing vibration frequencies:
\begin{align}
	\text{BPFO} &= f \times F_{\text{OR}} \label{eq:BPFO} \\
	\text{BPFI} &= f \times F_{\text{IR}} \label{eq:BPFI} \\
	\text{BSF}  &= f \times F_{\text{BS}} \label{eq:BSF} \\
	\text{FTF}  &= f \times F_{\text{FTF}} \label{eq:FTF}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{align*}
	&f    &&: \text{Shaft rotational speed (\si{\hertz})} \\
	&\text{BPFI} &&: \text{Ball pass frequency, inner race} \\
	&\text{BPFO} &&: \text{Ball pass frequency, outer race} \\
	&\text{FTF}  &&: \text{Fundamental train frequency} \\
	&\text{BSF}  &&: \text{Ball spin frequency} \\
	&Z    &&: \text{Number of rolling elements} \\
	&D    &&: \text{Pitch circle diameter of the bearing (\si{\milli\meter})} \\
	&d    &&: \text{Rolling element (ball) diameter (\si{\milli\meter})} \\
	&\alpha &&: \text{Contact angle (\si{\degree})} \\
\end{align*}

It is also worth noting that the bearing frequency factors can be obtained through: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Manufacturer-provided values
	\item Direct calculation using the above equations \eqref{eq:OR}--\eqref{eq:BS}
	\item Reverse calculation from measured vibration frequencies \eqref{eq:BPFO}--\eqref{eq:FTF}
\end{itemize}

To summarize the preceding analysis, Figure \ref{fig:faultTree} provides a clear visualization of the fault diagnosis procedure. When analysis reveals elevated frequency tones, a systematic approach must be followed to identify the source of these dominant frequencies. This process essentially involves mapping characteristic vibration patterns to specific machine faults on a frequency spectrum plot.

It must be that a fault-emulation method can be used in such cases to simulate the faulty models. This entails that additional tones can be stressed, and crucial spectra modifications may take place for research and comparison purposes.

% Summary of FFT, data flow, etc.
\subsection{Signal Processing}
\subsubsection{Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}
{

The Cooley-Tukey algorithm (1965) is a divide-and-conquer method that provides a fast algorithm for computing the complex Fourier transform efficiently:
\[
X_j = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x_k \exp\left( \frac{i2\pi jk}{n} \right) \quad \text{for} \quad j = 0,1,\dots,n-1,
\]

This reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ (naive DFT) to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, enabling major time savings for complex and large-scale transforms. The algorithm is implemented in major numerical packages including MATLAB and NumPy's FFT routines.
