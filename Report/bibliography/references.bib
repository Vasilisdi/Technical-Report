   abstract = {This paper addresses the Internet of Things. Main enabling factor of this promising paradigm is the integration of several technologies and communications solutions. Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gubbi2013,
   abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Dharmarathne2025,
   abstract = {Clean and safe water is fundamental to human health and environmental sustainability, yet increasing pollution due to urbanisation, industrialisation, and climate change poses significant risks. Traditional water quality monitoring relies on manual sampling and laboratory analysis, which are often costly, time-intensive, and lack real-time insights. This review critically examines the integration of machine learning (ML) and the internet of things (IoT) for real-time water quality monitoring and predictive analytics. The study evaluates peer-reviewed research published between 2016 and 2024, focusing on advancements, limitations, and future trends in automated water quality assessment. ML models, including random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machines, and neural networks, have been more frequently used in water quality research and have achieved high accuracies (R2=0.99 in regression and 0.99 accuracy metric in classification). Explainable AI (XAI) which can explain the decision making process of ML, is underutilised, appearing in only a few recent studies. While IoT significantly improves real-time contamination detection, persistent challenges remain in sensor fouling, data continuity, data privacy, network reliability, and cybersecurity. Such challenges can hinder the scalability and effectiveness of long-term IoT implementations. Integrating IoT with machine learning enhances water quality monitoring by enabling real-time data collection, remote tracking, and predictive analytics. This synergy improves efficiency, addresses monitoring challenges, and supports sustainable water management.},

  abstract = {A DSP-based measurement system dedicated to the vibration analysis on rotating machines was designed and realized. Vibration signals are on-line acquired and processed to obtain a continuous monitoring of the machine status. In case of a fault, the system is capable of isolating the fault with a high reliability. The paper describes in detail the approach followed to built up fault and unfault models together with the chosen hardware and software solutions. A number of tests carried out on small-size three-phase asynchronous motors highlight the excellent promptness in detecting faults, low false alarm rate, and very good diagnostic performance.},
